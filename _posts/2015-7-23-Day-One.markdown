I keep starting writing my first post and then stopping half-way. So here it is. The first post of 365 other posts that currently have no direction...

Some of my short-term goals:
+ Build a bench and a hammock
+ Design and build prototype for mobile chat platform (currently without a name)
+ Be happy
+ Take more walks
+ Increase reading speed
+ Read three books per month
+ Figure out if this blog has a purpose

Some of my long-term goals:
+ Be happy
+ Make money
+ Don't die
+ ...

Yep.
