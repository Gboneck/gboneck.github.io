This blog doesn't have a form right now. The first item on my list is to format the blog in some way to be more structured. I mean the blog has to, in some way, help give my life structure. My intent is to utilize the blog as a tool to help better myself through creation of habits while sharing my opinion with whoever is willing to reading this (thank you, whomever you are).

I'll jump right in. 

## Breakdown of goals

+ Increasing reading speed

I recently took two different reading speed tests ([1](http://www.readingsoft.com/), [2](http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/marketing/technology-research-centers/ereaders/speed-reader/)) and scored 156 WPM (words per minute) and 224 WPM, respectively. This is below average (240 is average with the best readers reaching 1000). Granted that is only half the equation, but it would seem I have lots of room for improvement.

The other half of the equation is reading efficacy or how much of the content is retained after reading. While I don't have a number for myself yet, the average is 65% scaling up to 85% in the upper echelon. This is a huge discrepancy. 

Think about it: an average reader reads 240 wpm at 65% efficiency:
 `240*.65 = 156`

 Where a talented reader can do 1000 wpm at 85%:
 `1000*.85 = 850` 

 In essence, this shows that increasing EWPM (effective words per minute) could lead to up to **4x** increase in reading ability.

+ Reading three (3) books per month

For some this might seem low. It is. This number will go up as my reading speed increases but I need a foundation to start off with. An adult book has an average of 90,000 words in it. 

Taking from my last point: 
`90,000 words / 180 wpm = 500 minutes`
`500 minutes = 8.34 hours`

I'll round up - if each book takes me nine hours to complete reading three books a month will take up **~30 hours of the month**.
